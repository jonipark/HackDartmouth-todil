## Inspiration
The question of "What did you gain from your internship?" proved to be more challenging to answer than I initially thought. While I undoubtedly acquired knowledge, I couldn't pinpoint a specific ‚Äúgem‚Äù of knowledge. As a result of this realization, I decided to start recording my daily learnings and created Todil, a tool that simplifies the process of documenting and organizing my entries, and helps me keep track of my ongoing education.

## What it does
Todil empowers individuals to take control of their own learning and development by tracking their progress in daily learning, reminding them to prioritize their personal growth and skill-building. Todil has a unique recap and weekly digest feature that provides positive feedback and celebrates users' learning, reminding them to prioritize their personal growth and skill-building in a world where AI is increasingly prevalent.

## How we built it

Our primary objective was to develop a framework that could meet the complex requirements of real-world industry applications. To achieve this, we approached the project with a focus on incorporating industry best practices and incorporating modern technology solutions.

One of the key components of our framework is the RESTful API server, which we developed using the popular Spring Boot framework. We chose this technology for its flexibility, ease of use, and robust feature. Additionally, we deployed the API server to Amazon EC2, a scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure that can accommodate our framework's requirements as well as using Amazon RDS for our database.

Another important aspect of our framework is its emphasis on providing a personalized experience for users. To accomplish this, we integrated the Open AI API into our platform. By leveraging the power of AI, we were able to generate insights and recommendations that are tailored to each user's unique preferences and behaviors. This approach enabled us to provide a more engaging and meaningful experience for users, ultimately resulting in higher engagement.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating a RESTful API with our local frontend development environment (blocked by CORS policy). We addressed this by setting up Access-Control in the Backend
Deciding on the distribution of responsibilities between frontend and backend for various features
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of building a product focused on helping people prioritize their learning. Furthermore, we are proud of building a full stack web application using an industry level framework within 24 hours. Moreover, we successfully integrated ChatGPT to offer users inspiring messages in their Weekly Digest.

## What we learned
To design a modular and scalable product
To determine a viable scope for the project given the time constraint
What's next for Todil
Enhance interaction in the Explore page with features like reactions and follow.
